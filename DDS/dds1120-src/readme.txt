DDS 1.1.17,  Bo Haglund 2012-11-07

For Win32, DDS compiles with Visual C++ 2010 Express edition 
and the TDM-GCC/Mingw port of gcc.

When using Visual C++, the statement
#include "stdafx.h" at the beginning of dds.cpp must be uncommented.
   

Linking with an application using DDS
-------------------------------------
The InitStart() function of DDS should be called from inside the
application. Then SolveBoard in DDS can be called multiple times
without the overhead of InitStart() at each call.
For this purpose, the application code must have an include
statement for the dll.h file in DDS.


Options at DDS compilation
--------------------------
Compiling options:

1) Compilation without definitions of STAT or TTDEBUG.
This is the default case given in the distributed source
where definitions of STAT and TTDEBUG are commented away.
This compilation alternative gives the best performance.

By default the PBN versions for remaning cards in the deal information 
are included in SolveBoardPBN. Removing the PBN definition in dll.h
will make a compilation without this function. This can be useful
if this version is to replace an older version, and the application 
using DDS cannot accept an interface change towards DDS.

2) Compilation with definition STAT.
Uncomment the definition of STAT.
This gives deal search statistics information for each call
to SolveBoard, logged in stat.txt. Set target to a number of
tricks to be won by player's side and solutions=1
(avoid to set target to -1 and solutions different than 1,
because then the statistics output will be mixed for the
different repeated searches).

"score statistics" provides information on which depth the search
terminated and some termination information as described below. 
(Only a few searches terminate at the last trick.)

s1 = number of TRUE score values found
s0 = number of FALSE score values found
c1 = number of cutoffs because won tricks by player side >= target
c2 = number of cutoffs because won tricks by player side plus
     tricks left to play < target
c3 = as for c1 but with quick tricks evaluation
c4 = as for c2 but with quick tricks evaluation
c5 = number of transposition table cutoffs for player's (MAX) side 
c6 = number of transposition table cutoffs for opponent's (MIN) side
c7 = number of terminations at the last trick (i.e. when depth is 0)
c8 = number of cases when a new transposition table entry was added


3) Compilation with definition TTDEBUG.
Uncomment the definition of TTDEBUG.
Note that setting this option will make the double dummy solver very
slow!
This is indended for debugging of the transposition table logic.
Without this support, it can be extremely hard to find the reason for
a transposition table erroneous behaviour.
Set target to a number of tricks to be won by player's side and 
solutions=1 (not using target -1 and solutions different than 1).
Information of a number of transposition table hits will then be
recorded in the file rectt.txt. The number of recorded hits is defined
by SEARCHSIZE. Also, hit information will be stored in a structure
ttStore.
All transposition table entries generated during the time when transposition 
table hits are recorded, are logged in the file storett.txt.
After SolveBoard terminates, the following code snippet 
(or something similar) is called:


int k, m, val, h, s, iniDepth;
int lastTTstore, suppressTTlog;
struct moveType startMoves[3];
struct ttStoreType *ttStore;
struct nodeCardsType * cardsP;
struct pos thisPos;
FILE *fp;


fp=fopen("recpos.txt", "w");
suppressTTlog=TRUE;
for (k=0; k<=lastTTstore-1; k++) {
  for (m=0; m<=2; m++) {
    startMoves[m].suit=-1;
    startMoves[m].rank=-1;
  }
  for (h=0; h<=3; h++)
    for (s=0; s<=3; s++)
      thisPos.rankInSuit[h][s]=ttStore[k].suit[h][s];
  thisPos.handRelFirst=0;
  iniDepth=4 * ttStore[k].tricksLeft-4;
  thisPos.first[iniDepth-1]=ttStore[k].first;
  InitSearch(&thisPos, iniDepth, startMoves, ttStore[k].first, 0);
  val=ABsearch(&thisPos, ttStore[k].target, iniDepth);
  if (val==tt[k].scoreFlag)
    fprintf(fp, "No %d is OK\n", k);
  else {
    fprintf(fp, "No %d is not OK\n", k);
    fprintf(fp, "cardsP=%d\n", 
      ttStore[k].cardsP);
  }      
} 
fclose(fp);
suppressTTlog=FALSE; 


A "not OK" row number in file recpos.txt corresponds to an 
entry with the same number for lastTTstore in the file rectt.txt.
rectt.txt contain the cards and other information related to
the position getting the transposition table hit. It also contains
the pointer to the SOP (Subsets Of Positions) node, cardsP.
The SOP pointer cardsP value can be found in the storett.txt file, where
also the winning cards and other information of the transposition
table entry can be found.
By now comparing the information in rectt.txt with the information
in storett.txt for the same SOP node pointer, it is usually not too
difficult to deduce what caused the problem.
